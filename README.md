# LPUniversity Mudlib #

The LPUniversity Mudlib was downloaded from http://lpmuds.net/downloads.html and converted and fixed to work with the current version of FluffOS 2019 before being posted to this git repository.

## FluffOS ##

* FluffOS can be downloaded from Github at https://github.com/fluffos/fluffos
* FluffOS build instructions: https://www.fluffos.info/build.html

## Special notes ##

* This mudlib requires that the driver be compiled with `-DPACKAGE_UIDS=OFF`
* All original documentation, licenses, copyright information has been moved to /ARCHIVE.
* The first user to login will become admin. This is due to the existence of `/adm/etc/new_install` file. This file is removed following the creation of the first user.
