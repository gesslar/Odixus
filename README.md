# gLPU - LPUniversity #

The LPUniversity Mudlib was downloaded from http://dead-souls.net/files/lpuni_fluffos_v1.zip and converted and fixed to work with the current version of FluffOS 2019 before being posted to this git repository.

This is now gLPU, which is Gesslar's LPU, a fork of LPUniversity.
