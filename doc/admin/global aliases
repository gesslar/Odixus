It is possible to setup global aliases that apply to the whole mud
and to individual groups by editing the global alias server configuration
file in /adm/etc/aliases

There are two parts to each "alias block"; the assignment declaration
and the alias definitions. The assignment declaration is at the start
of each block of aliases and it designates who the following aliases
willy be applied to. Each line after that is an alias definition until
another assignment declaration is encountered.

In the assignment declaration, you may put groups defined in /adm/etc/groups
or "all" to apply to everyone. You can put multiple groups in the assignment
declaration by putting a space inbetween each group name.

Each assignment declaration starts with ':;' and ends with ':'. In between,
there is a list seperated by spaces of who the following aliases will be
applied to.

Example 1: Alias block assigned to group named 'developer'

:;developer:
link ln $*
netstat sockinfo $*
man help $*

Example 2: Alias block assigned to group 'blah' and group 'bargle'.

:;blag bargle:
lol laugh out loud

aliases, please refer to technical documentation in /doc/mudlib/
