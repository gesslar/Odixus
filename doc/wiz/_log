void _log([int level,] string message, mixed args...)

The _log function is found in /std/modules/ and can be added by inheriting
M_LOG.

The function will log messages to the console and to /log/debug.log

When logging, if you do not specify a log level, it will default to 1.

    0 - silent/emergency
    1 - normal operational messages you want to show
    2 - kind of nerdy, lower level stuff, but not super nerdy
    3 - super nerdy, incredibly technical things
    4 - everything
