		or mud clients. Some tags (such as FLASH) might not render at all!
	* Also make sure to use a RESET tag when you are done or your colour
		may leak (and people will be angry!).
	* See /adm/daemons/ansi_parser.c for the other available tags.
	* Certain tags are filtered when users input them for protection
		See /adm/daemons/ansi_parser.c for more details.
