Name    : Release Cycle & Naming
Author  : Tacitus @ LPUni
Date    : 10-NOV-05
Updated : 10-NOV-05

As of November 10th 2005, LPUniversity follows the following
release cycle and naming method (trial).

**RELEASE NAMING:

     SYNTAX: STAGE-yymm-(P)R#

RULES:

STAGE will be on the following:

     Alpha  : Stage 1
     Beta   : Stage 2
     Gamma  : Stage 3

yy is the last two digits of the year of the release
mm is the month number the release occured in
# will be the actual release number (floats for minor releases)
P will be added before R# if the release is a pre-release.

EXAMPLE: ALPHA-0511-PR2

The STAGE can be omitted when appropraite.

EXAMPLE: 0511-R2.3

**RELEASE CYCLE:

LPUniversity is a very dynamic project and hence a set
release schedual can not be set. However, the project
will try to maintain consistancy. Hopefuly we can make
a release every 3 months (with minor releases inbetween
if required).
