  INTRODUCTION:
  
The global alias server allows for global aliases that
will be inherited by all users or certain groups of users.
The global alias daemon allows for the assignment of aliases
to groups and to the mystical "all" group.

  ADDING ALIASES:
  
There is a function provided for adding aliases. However,
it is only available internally. For a global alias to be
added, the config file must be edited (or a tool must be
used to modify it for you).

  CONFIG FILE FORMAT:
  
The config file is defined by a preproccessor statement at the
top of the file. By default, it is set to /adm/etc/aliases

In the config file, all blank lines and lines that begin with
'#' (the pound sign) are ignored.

The first unignored line in the config file (the first line
that will be parsed), must be an assignment definition. An
assignment definition is a line that defines who the following
aliases will be assigned to. An assignment definition has the
following format:

 :;<group1> <group2> <group3> ...:

<groupN> will be replaced with the name of the group. You may
have multiple groups seperated by white spaces (" "). Groups
are groups that have been defined in /adm/etc/groups
You may also use the magic group 'all'.

After the assignment definiton, you will have the alias definitions.
An alias definition is the same that you would provide to the alias
command for local aliases. 

The following is an example config file:

You can define xverbs by putting a '$' in front of the verb

  GETTING ALIAS DATA:
  
There are really only two functions that developers might be
interested in calling, mapping get_alias(string priv)' and
'mapping get_xverb(string priv)'. In both cases, the argument
is the priv of the user so that the daemon can determin
which aliases to return in a mapping. The mapping's key is the
verb aliased, and the value is the actual alias.

  RELOADING ALIAS DATA:
  
When the ga server is updated, it will reparse the config file.
