\ebl1\eFeedback Level\eres\e determines the tagging in front of system messages.

You can set your feedback level by typing `set_env feedback_level <level>`.

Feedback level options are:

* none - no feedback tagging
* normal - will attempt to use Unicode tagging
* plain - will use only ASCII characters

If you have feedback level other than `none`, the tagging will be appropriately coloured:

* green - success
* red - error
* orange - warning
* yellow - info
* blue - question

Note

* If you have a screenreader, this is automatically set to none.
* If you have colour disabled, it will still send you the tagged messages, but without the colour. This helps identify that you are receiving a system message.
