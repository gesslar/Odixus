 2. colour
 3. prompt
 4. page_display

Developers only:

 5. start_location
 6. news_client
 7. morelines
 8. biff
 9. debug_output
10. custom_clone, custom_dest
11. move_in, move_out

\e0015\eVariable\eres\e    : auto_tune
\e0005\eArguments\eres\e   : Channels/Modules names

you wish to automatically tune into when you login. If you wish to tune into
multiple channels or modules, separate the names by spaces.

\e0011\eNote:\eres\e Case does matter.

\e0015\eVariable\eres\e    : colour
\e0005\eArguments\eres\e   : enabled || disabled
\e0012\eExample\eres\e     : enabled
\e0002\eDescription\eres\e :

This variable allows you to toggle the rendering of colour. If not set to
'enabled' then colour will not render (ie. disabled is a pseudo argument.

\e0011\eNote:\eres\e You may also use the "colour" command to
toggle this environmental variable.

\e0015\eVariable\eres\e    : prompt
\e0005\eArguments\eres\e   : <tokens>
\e0012\eExample\eres\e     : %t >
\e0002\eDescription\eres\e :

        This variable allows you to construct a custom prompt using

        everyone:

        %n -> Your name, %m -> Mud's name, %t -> Current time
        $n-> Line break/new line

        Developers may also use the following tokens:

        %d -> CWD, %f -> CWF, %u -> Current # of users logged in
        %l -> Filename of current environment

        \e0011\eNote:\eres\e Please let us know if you have anymore
                ideas for tokens.

\e0015\eVariable\eres\e    : page_display
\e0005\eArguments\eres\e   : percent | lines
\e0012\eExample\eres\e     : percent
\e0002\eDescription\eres\e :

        This variable allows you to change whether you see the percentage
        of a document viewed or the line numbers of the current page of
        a document.

\e0015\eVariable\eres\e    : start_location
\e0005\eArguments\eres\e   : Full path to room or 'last_location'
\e0012\eExample\eres\e     : /areas/lpuni/entrance.c
\e0002\eDescription\eres\e :

This variable allows you to set a start_location besides the
standard one if you are a developer (ie. If you are not a developer
then setting this environmental variable will have no effect).
You may provide a full path to a room or set it to last_location
to return to the last room you were in before logging out.

If developers do not set a start_location, they will default to
their workroom.c in their home directory (if it exists - if not
then the same as players). Players start in /areas/lpuni/entrance.c

\e0015\eVariable\eres\e    : morelines
\e0005\eArguments\eres\e   : number of lines
\e0012\eExample\eres\e     : 40
\e0002\eDescription\eres\e :

This variable will set how many lines appear per cycle whenever
text needs to be paged.

\e0015\eVariable\eres\e    : biff
\e0005\eArguments\eres\e   : on | off
\e0012\eExample\eres\e     : on
\e0002\eDescription\eres\e :

This variable will set whether or not you recieve the new mail
notification when you log in, or when someone sends you a piece
of mail.

\e0015\eVariable\eres\e    : debug_output
\e0005\eArguments\eres\e   : enabled || disabled
\e0012\eExample\eres\e     : disabled
\e0002\eDescription\eres\e :

This variable allows you to disable the output of compile
time errors. If set to 'disabled' then compile time errors
will not be printed to your terminal (such as when you use
the 'update' command; ie. 'enabled' is a pseudo argument).
The compile time errors however will be written to the log
files as usual.

\e0001\eWarning:\eres\e When you use eval, you'll notice that it won't
print anything if there are any compile-time errors if you have this enabled.

\e0015\eVariable\eres\e    : custom_clone/custom_dest
\e0005\eArguments\eres\e   : <message to be printed>
\e0012\eExample\eres\e     : $Npiledrives

\e0005\eArguments\eres\e   : <message to be printed>
\e0012\eExample\eres\e     : $Nflys away to the
