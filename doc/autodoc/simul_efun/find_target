varargs object find_target(object tp, string arg, object source, function f)

Parameters:

* `object tp` - The body object of the player or NPC searching
* `string arg` - The argument to match objects against
* `object source` - The object to search within, such as a room or container. If not provided, the environment of the calling object will be used.
* `function f` - An optional custom filter function to further filter

Returns

`object` - The located object, or 0 if not found.

This simul_efun will find a single object in a container, such
as a room, chest, player's inventory, that matches the specified
argument. The argument can be a name, ID, or other identifier
that can be used to match objects.

The simul_efun will then filter the objects based on the
visibility of the calling object, and apply an additional
custom filter function if provided.
