varargs object *find_targets(object tp, string arg, object source, function f)

Parameters:

* `object tp` - The body object of the player or NPC searching
* `string arg` - The argument to match objects against
* `object source` - The object to search within, such as a room or container. If not provided, the environment of the calling object will be used.
* `function f` - An optional custom filter function to further filter the objects.

Returns

`object*` - An array of located objects or 0 if none are found.

This simul_efun will find all objects in a container, such as
a room, chest, player's inventory, that match the specified
argument. The argument can be a name, ID, or other identifier
that can be used to match objects.

The simul_efun will then filter the objects based on the
visibility of the calling object, and apply an additional
custom filter function if provided.
