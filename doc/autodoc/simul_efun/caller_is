int caller_is(mixed ob)

Parameters:

* `mixed ob` - The object or file name to compare the caller to.

Returns

`int` - 1 if the caller is the specified object, 0 otherwise.

This simul_efun will return 1 if the caller of the current
operation is the specified object, or if the caller is the
object with the specified file name.

*NOTE* This simul_efun will not succeed when called from
other functions in the simul_efun object, as previous_object()
does not count the object itself in its call list.
