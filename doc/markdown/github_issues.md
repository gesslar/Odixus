To integrate gLPU with GitHub issues, you need to setup a Personal Access Token
(PAT) in your GitHub account. This token is used to authenticate the your game
with GitHub. You can store your token anywhere in the game, or use the ENV_D
to store it outside the game, which is recommended as it is more secure.
